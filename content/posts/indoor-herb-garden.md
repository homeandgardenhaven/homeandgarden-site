## <span class="emoji">üí°</span> Setting Up Your Indoor Herb Garden

### Container & Soil
- **Drainage is crucial** ‚Äì Use pots with holes.
- **Size matters** ‚Äì Most herbs need 6‚Äì8 inch deep containers.
- **Material choices** ‚Äì Terracotta breathes, plastic retains moisture.
- **Soil** ‚Äì Use a high-quality, well-draining potting mix.

### Watering & Fertilizing
- Water when the top inch of soil is dry.
- Fertilize lightly once a month with diluted liquid fertilizer.

1. **Pinch regularly** to promote bushy growth.
2. **Harvest in the morning** after dew dries but before heat.
3. **Take no more than 1/3** of the plant at a time.
4. **Cut just above leaf pairs** to encourage new shoots.

## Common Problems and Solutions

**Leggy growth**: Usually indicates insufficient light - move closer to light source or add grow lights.

**Yellowing leaves**: Often overwatering - allow soil to dry between waterings.

**Pest issues**: Check for aphids or spider mites - rinse with water or use insecticidal soap.

Start with just 2-3 herbs that you use most in cooking, and expand your indoor garden as you gain confidence. Fresh herbs will transform your cooking and give you the satisfaction of growing your own food!
