## <span class="emoji">ðŸŒž</span> What to Plant in Summer

Summer is the season of abundance! Choose crops that thrive in heat and long days:

- **Tomatoes** â€“ The classic summer crop, perfect for salads, sauces, and snacking. Try cherry, beefsteak, or heirloom varieties.
- **Peppers** â€“ Bell, jalapeÃ±o, and banana peppers all love the sun.
- **Zucchini & Summer Squash** â€“ Fast-growing and prolific, just one or two plants can feed a family.

- **Cucumbers** â€“ Crisp and refreshing, great for pickling or eating fresh.
- **Beans** â€“ Bush and pole beans are easy and productive.
- **Basil & Herbs** â€“ Basil, oregano, and thyme all thrive in summer heat and add flavor to your harvests.

## <span class="emoji">ðŸ“…</span> When to Plant

Timing is everything! Most summer crops can be started after your regionâ€™s last frost date. Use a [planting calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planting_calendar) or check with your local extension office. Warm-season crops need soil temperatures above 60Â°F (16Â°C) to germinate and grow well.

If youâ€™re starting seeds indoors, begin 4â€“6 weeks before the last frost. Harden off seedlings by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions before transplanting.

## <span class="emoji">ðŸ’¡</span> Tips for Success

- **Rotate crops** each year to prevent soil-borne diseases and pest buildup. Donâ€™t plant tomatoes in the same spot two years in a row!
- **Mulch** around plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and keep roots cool. Organic mulches like straw or shredded leaves work best.
- **Water deeply** in the morning to encourage deep roots and reduce evaporation. Drip irrigation or soaker hoses are most efficient.
- **Fertilize** with compost or a balanced organic fertilizer. Avoid over-fertilizing, which can lead to lush leaves but fewer fruits.
- **Support vining crops** like tomatoes and cucumbers with stakes, cages, or trellises to save space and improve air circulation.
- **Watch for pests** like aphids, hornworms, and squash bugs. Hand-pick or use natural controls. See our [Natural Pest Control for Summer Gardens]({{< ref "natural-pest-control-summer.md" >}}) for more tips.
