Summer heat can turn even the most lush garden into a thirsty landscape. Plants lose water quickly through their leaves, and soil can dry out in a matter of hours. But with a few smart strategies, you can keep your garden thriving and resilient—even during a drought or heatwave. Let’s dive into the details that make every drop count.

## When to Water

Timing is everything. **Early morning** is the gold standard for watering—temperatures are cooler, winds are calmer, and less water is lost to evaporation. If you water in the evening, leaves may stay wet overnight, increasing the risk of fungal diseases. Avoid watering during the hottest part of the day, when most of the moisture will simply evaporate before reaching the roots.

## How Much to Water

Shallow, frequent watering encourages weak, surface-level roots. Instead, water deeply and less often to help plants develop strong, drought-resistant root systems. Aim for the soil to be moist 6–8 inches down. For best results, use soaker hoses or a drip irrigation system to deliver water right to the root zone—this minimizes waste and keeps foliage dry.

## Water Conservation Tips

Conserving water is crucial in hot weather. Here’s how to make the most of every drop:
- **Mulch generously** around plants with straw, bark, or compost to keep soil cool and moist. Mulch acts as a barrier, reducing evaporation and suppressing weeds that compete for water.
- **Group plants** with similar water needs together so you can water efficiently and avoid over- or under-watering.
- **Collect rainwater** in barrels or cisterns for use during dry spells. Even a brief summer shower can provide valuable irrigation if you’re set up to capture it.

## Preventing Drought Stress

Plants show stress in subtle ways before they wilt. Watch for leaves that curl, turn dull, or yellow at the edges—these are early signs of drought stress. If a heatwave is coming, provide temporary shade with a lightweight cloth or move potted plants out of direct sun. Water deeply before the hottest days to help plants withstand the heat.
