A beautiful lawn is possible even in the heat of summer. Hereâ€™s how to keep your grass healthy:

- Never cut more than 1/3 of the grass height

## Watering Schedule
- Water early in the morning
- Aim for 1 inch of water per week (including rainfall)

## Fertilizing
- Use a slow-release, summer-safe fertilizer
- Avoid fertilizing during drought

## Dealing with Brown Spots
- Check for grubs or fungal disease
- Water deeply and infrequently
