<span class="emoji">üêû</span> Summer brings a surge of garden pests, but you don‚Äôt have to reach for harsh chemicals to protect your plants. With a little knowledge and some natural strategies, you can keep your garden thriving and your harvests healthy. Here‚Äôs how to keep pests at bay‚Äînaturally!

## <span class="emoji">üîç</span> Common Summer Pests

Every garden is a mini-ecosystem, and summer‚Äôs warmth brings out both the good and the bad bugs. Watch for:

- **Aphids** ‚Äì Tiny, soft-bodied insects that cluster on new growth and suck plant sap. They can cause leaves to curl and stunt growth.
- **Squash bugs** ‚Äì Flat, brownish bugs that attack squash, zucchini, and pumpkins, causing wilting and yellowing.
- **Tomato hornworms** ‚Äì Large green caterpillars that can strip tomato plants overnight. Look for their droppings and hand-pick them.
- **Cabbage loopers** ‚Äì Green caterpillars that chew holes in cabbage, kale, and broccoli leaves.
- **Spider mites** ‚Äì Microscopic pests that cause stippling and webbing on leaves, especially in hot, dry weather.

For more on identifying pests, see [Wikipedia: Garden Pest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_pest).

## <span class="emoji">üåø</span> Organic Solutions

Natural pest control is about balance. Here are some proven methods:

- **Hand-pick large pests** like hornworms and squash bugs. Drop them in soapy water.
- **Spray aphids** with a strong jet of water or use insecticidal soap or neem oil (always test on a small area first).
- **Encourage beneficial insects** such as ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Plant flowers like dill, fennel, and marigolds to attract them.
- **Try companion planting**‚Äîfor example, marigolds deter nematodes and aphids, while basil can help repel tomato hornworms. See our {{< ref "companion-planting.md" >}} article for more ideas.
- **Keep your garden clean** by removing dead leaves and debris where pests can hide.

## <span class="emoji">üß™</span> Homemade Pest Sprays

DIY sprays can help control soft-bodied insects:

- **Soap spray:** Mix 1 tsp mild dish soap with 1 quart water. Spray on affected leaves (avoid in full sun).
- **Garlic-chili spray:** Blend 1 head garlic, 1 hot pepper, and 2 cups water. Strain, dilute to 1 quart, and spray on pests.

Always test homemade sprays on a few leaves first and reapply after rain.

## <span class="emoji">üí°</span> More Tips & Resources

- **Rotate crops** each year to break pest cycles.
- **Mulch** to prevent soil-borne pests from splashing onto leaves.
- **Inspect plants regularly**‚Äîearly detection is key!
