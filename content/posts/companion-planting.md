Companion planting is one of the oldest and most effective gardening techniques. By strategically placing plants together, you can improve growth, reduce pests, and maximize your garden's productivity naturally.

## What is Companion Planting?

Companion planting involves growing different plants together that benefit each other in various ways:

- **Pest control** - some plants repel insects that harm others
- **Nutrient sharing** - different plants have different nutrient needs
- **Space efficiency** - tall plants can shade shorter ones
- **Pollinator attraction** - flowers attract beneficial insects
- **Soil improvement** - some plants fix nitrogen or improve soil structure

## Classic Companion Combinations

### The Three Sisters (Native American technique)
- **Corn** provides support for beans
- **Beans** fix nitrogen in soil for corn and squash
- **Squash** leaves shade soil and deter pests

### Tomatoes and Basil
- Basil may improve tomato flavor
- Strong basil scent deters tomato hornworms
- Both love warm weather and similar water needs

### Carrots and Chives
- Chives repel carrot flies
- Carrots don't compete with shallow-rooted chives
- Both can be harvested at different times

## Beneficial Plant Partnerships

### Pest-Repelling Plants
- **Marigolds** - deter nematodes and many garden pests
- **Nasturtiums** - trap crop for aphids and cucumber beetles
- **Garlic and onions** - repel many insects with their strong scent
- **Catnip** - more effective than DEET against mosquitoes

### Nitrogen-Fixing Plants
- **Beans and peas** - add nitrogen to soil
- **Clover** - living mulch that fixes nitrogen
- **Comfrey** - deep roots bring nutrients to surface

### Pollinator Attractors
- **Lavender** - attracts bees and beneficial insects
- **Cosmos** - long-blooming annual that feeds pollinators
- **Sunflowers** - attract beneficial predator insects

## Plants to Keep Apart

Some plants don't play well together:

- **Black walnut trees** - toxic to tomatoes, peppers, potatoes
- **Fennel** - inhibits growth of most other plants
- **Eucalyptus** - allelopathic effects on nearby plants
- **Beans and onions** - beans don't thrive near alliums

## Planning Your Companion Garden

### Start Small
- Begin with proven combinations
- Observe how plants interact in your specific conditions
- Keep detailed garden notes

### Consider Timing
- Plant companions at appropriate times
- Some may need staggered planting dates
- Plan for succession planting

### Think Vertically
- Use tall plants to support climbers
- Create microclimates with height variations
- Maximize space with layered planting

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overcrowding** - companions still need adequate space
2. **Ignoring individual needs** - water and light requirements should still match
3. **Expecting magic** - companion planting helps but isn't a cure-all
4. **Not testing** - what works elsewhere may not work in your garden

## Scientific vs. Traditional Knowledge

While some companion planting benefits are well-documented scientifically, others are based on generations of gardening wisdom. Both have value:

- **Proven benefits**: nitrogen fixation, pest deterrence through scent
- **Traditional wisdom**: flavor improvement, growth enhancement
- **Your experience**: keep records of what works in your garden

Remember, gardening is both art and science. Companion planting is a tool that, when used thoughtfully, can create a more productive, beautiful, and sustainable garden ecosystem.
